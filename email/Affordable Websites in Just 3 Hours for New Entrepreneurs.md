# Affordable Websites in Just 3 Hours for New Entrepreneurs

## Why Every Business Needs a Website

Every entrepreneur and company needs a website. A well-designed website helps you showcase who you are, what services you provide, and the products you offer. However, for new entrepreneurs, budget constraints often pose a significant challenge. Creating professional websites can cost thousands of dollars—an expense that's especially daunting when sales are not yet rolling in.

In this article, we'll explore how new entrepreneurs can create affordable websites in just three hours. While these websites are not a substitute for professional ones built on platforms like WordPress or Squarespace, they serve as a temporary solution to get your online presence started and revenue flowing. Later, you can invest in a professionally crafted website.

If you're offering expert services, personal coaching, speaking engagements, or mentorship, this solution is tailored to your needs.

## Affordable Websites in 3 Hours for New Entrepreneurs

### What Do We Mean by "Affordable"?

By "affordable," I mean a website that costs $49 per month to maintain. The service requires a credit card for activation and offers over 50 templates to choose from, so you're sure to find one that suits your brand.

### Customization Made Simple

The websites are built using a block editor. This means that by hovering your mouse over a specific block, you can easily edit fonts, colors, images, and text as you like—no coding or graphic design skills needed. Editing individual pages is just a click away via the sidebar menu.

For example, while the tool allows you to include a blog in your navigation menu, managing a blog on this platform is cumbersome. Each post would require a separate page and manual linking, making it impractical for those planning to blog extensively. For most users, this platform is best suited for expert services and coaching businesses.

### SEO and Social Media Integration

The platform allows you to edit page settings, including SEO titles and meta descriptions. This ensures your pages are optimized for search engines and appear attractive in search results. Additionally, you can control how your website looks when shared on social media, customizing both text and images to ensure a professional appearance.

> **Pro Tip:** Name your pages thoughtfully, using keywords relevant to your business or brand for better search engine visibility.

### Mobile-Optimized and Easy to Use

The platform is fully mobile-optimized, ensuring that your website looks great on any device—desktop, tablet, or smartphone. Plus, it includes a built-in 404 error page, which you can customize to fit your brand.

Although the tool allows you to create up to 100 pages, I recommend sticking to a clean structure with 4–5 key pages to keep things simple and effective.

### Why Choose This Platform?

This solution is perfect for entrepreneurs who need a quick, affordable, and effective website. While it lacks advanced features like e-commerce, blogging, or course platforms, it excels as a temporary tool to kickstart your online presence.

## Alternatives for Building Your Website

### DIY Website Creation

If you'd prefer to create a website yourself, you can purchase a domain from Domainhotelli and a web hosting service from Zoner. Using WordPress, you can build a basic website at little to no additional cost—though it may take some time and effort to set up.

### Professional Website Design

I also offer simple WordPress websites once you’ve secured your domain and hosting. My fee is €697 (including VAT), but this doesn't include graphic design services. I use free WordPress themes to keep costs down.

If you want to invest in a high-quality website, I recommend reaching out to a professional designer. Their expertise can make a significant difference in your brand’s online presence.

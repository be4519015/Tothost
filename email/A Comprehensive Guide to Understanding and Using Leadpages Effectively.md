## Optimizing Your Call-to-Action (CTA)

The CTA button is critical to landing page success. Leadpages’ button widget provides:
- **Customization Options**: Adjust font, size, colors, and styles.
- **Preset Styles**: Quickly create professional-looking buttons with advanced effects.
- **Advanced Linking**: Link to other Leadpages, Leadboxes, or custom URLs, supporting seamless two-step opt-ins.

For example, instead of displaying signup details immediately, a two-step opt-in displays a pop-up after users click the CTA, which can significantly boost conversion rates.

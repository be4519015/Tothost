## Why Email Marketing Matters

According to marketing expert Jason Pantana, four out of five top marketers would give up their social media accounts before their email lists. Why?

If your account is suspended, hacked, or inaccessible, you risk losing your audience. But your email list? That’s yours to keep.

## The Key Question: How Do You Grow Your Email List?
